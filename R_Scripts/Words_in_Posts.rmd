#Analyzing the distribution of the Forms of Words

library(ggplot2)
head(Words)

table(Words$NUM_WORDS)

#Viewing the distribuition of No. of FORMS of a particular word
```{r}
ggplot(data=Words,aes(NUM_WORDS))+
  geom_histogram(stat="count",color='black',fill='#5678A0')+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1))
```
Notes: As visible most of the words have been used only in one of their FORM. Let's plot the ratio of Words belonging to one of the various FORMS

#Proportion of Words present in respective FORM Categories
```{r}
ggplot(data=Words, aes(NUM_WORDS,POSTS))+
  geom_point(color='red')+
  geom_freqpoly(stat='summary',fun.y=max)+
  geom_freqpoly(stat='summary',fun.y=mean,color='blue')+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,150,25))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1))
